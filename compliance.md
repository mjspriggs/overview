## EU support for your account
{: #eu-support-overview}

You can add an extra layer of protection to your data in the European Union. Turning on EU support for your account ensures that any support ticket that you create is sent to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} support teams in Europe. An EU supported account is useful if, for example, you use resources to process personal data for European citizens. For more information, see [Enabling EU support for your account](/docs/account?topic=account-eu-supported).

## HIPAA support for your account
{: #hipaa-overview}

The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act define standards for handling electronic healthcare transactions and information. If you or your company is a covered entity as defined by HIPAA, you must enable the HIPAA Supported setting if you run sensitive workloads that are regulated under HIPAA and the HITECH Act. By using this setting, you can filter on HIPAA Enabled services in the catalog, indicate to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} that your account stores protected health information (PHI), and digitally accept the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Associate Addendum for covered entities. For more information, see [Enabling HIPAA support for your account](/docs/account?topic=account-enabling-hipaa).
