# Understanding data residency in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #data-residency}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}'s global network of locations provides you with the flexibility of choosing where you want to run your workloads.
{: shortdesc}

For regional and zonal services, you request instances of the service to be deployed in a specific region in accordance with your specific geographic requirements. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ensures that content that is provided by you and your workload (as defined in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Service Agreement](http://www.ibm.com/terms/?id=Z126-6304&cc=us){: external}) is stored and processes locally in the selected region location. For a complete list of the locations where {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services are available see [Service and infrastructure availability by location](/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region).

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} also maintains internal encrypted backups of the customer content within the same geography where the regional or zonal service is located for recovery in case of data corruption or a major data center disaster.

About your business contact and account usage information (as defined in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Service Agreement](http://www.ibm.com/terms/?id=Z126-6304&cc=us){: external}), also called client’s metadata, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} stores and processes them where the control planes of the regional and global services are located. 

- Regional services typically have control planes that are located in the same region where you selected for the service except for the services indicated in [Services with global control planes](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#service-global-control-plane).
- Global services control planes locations are indicated in [Global platform services](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#global-platform).

For a complete list of data attributes that are stored and processed by each single {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service you can refer to the documentation of the API of each service in the [API and SDK reference library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=api-docs).
