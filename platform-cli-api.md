* [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI reference](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli)

For every service, release notes and change logs are recorded for each update that is delivered. As of 1 January 2022, services will maintain release notes for a minimum of three years. You can view release notes in each service's documentation, or you can go to the [IBM Cloud Status UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/status/release-notes) to view release notes for all services in one place where you can search, filter by component, or filter by date.

From the Explore tab on the [Docs home page](https://{DomainName}/docs), you can quickly find what you're looking for whether it's a specific API and SDK reference for a service you're using, or how to get started with the CLI. Check out the following demo that shows you how to filter the API and SDK reference library for all AI/Machine Learning services, and then move to the Develop tab to copy the CLI install command to get set up.
